# ✍️ Tweet Composer UI Component

## Project Description

This repository contains a simple, pure **HTML** and **CSS** component that replicates the user interface of a social media "tweet" or post composer.

The primary feature of this project is the implementation of dedicated **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode** themes, showcasing how to style complex UIs for different visual preferences using standard CSS techniques.
